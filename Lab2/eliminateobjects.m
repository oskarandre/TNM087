%% Eliminates objects smaller than those enclosed by a square of size q x q
%
% Eliminates objects smaller than (or equal to) those enclosed by a square
% of size q x q pixels by filtering the image by appropriate box kernel in
% one pass of the kernel over the image followed by thresholding the
% filtered result by an appropriate threshold value. In the input image,
% the background pixels have an intensity of B=0.1 and all objects have an
% average intensity value of Q=0.8. Suppose that we want to reduce the
% average intensity of those objects to one fourth of the average intensity
% of the objects (or less). That is, we want to reduce the average
% intensity to Q/4 or less.

%% Syntax of the function
%      Input arguments:
%           im: the original input grayscale image of type double scaled
%               between 0 and 1, containing a number of objects
%           q: The size that is specified in the task (all objects smaller
%              than (or equal to) those enclosed by a square of size q×q
%              pixels have to be eliminated)
%
%      Output argument:
%           output: is the input image, in which all objects smaller
%                   than q x q are eliminated

%% Finding the size of the box filter
Q=0.8; %The average intensity of the objects
B=0.1; %The background pixel intensity
%
% we want to reduce the average intensity of the objects smaller than q x q
% to Q/4. Write the equation to calculate the size of the box filter (n xn) 
% based on B and Q.
% The equation here:
% formel från lektion 2
n_formula = q*sqrt((4*(Q-B))/(Q-(4*B))) % The size of the required filter
    
%% Find the smallest (odd) size of the filter here:

n1 = ceil(n_formula);   %Runda av uppåt

if(mod(n1,2)==0)    %ifall resten av n1/2 == 0, addera 1 (blir ojämnt).
    n1 = n1+1;
end

n = n1;  % the smallest odd size of the filter

%% Construct the box kernel here:

fbox = ones(n,n)/(n^2); % the box filter kernel


%% Apply the box filter kernel to the image here:

im_filt = imfilter(im,fbox,"symmetric"); % the filtered image


%% Threshold the filtered image
% If you have done everything correctly so far, the background and all
% objects smaller than q x q will hold pixel values smaller than Q/4.
% Use an appropriate threshold value (what is an appropriate threshold value?) 
% to threshold the filtered image. Call the resulting image
% after thresholding o_thresh. In this image, the background and all objects
% smaller than q×q are supposed to be black (0) and larger objects and
% around them to be white (1). Notice that you don't need to use for loops
% here. This operation can be done by only a one-line MATLAB command.
% Threshold the filtered result here:

    %Gör binär (0 eller 1).
o_thresh = imbinarize(im_filt, Q/4); % The result of thresholding the filtered image

%% Create the output image
% Use the thresholded image (o_thresh) as a mask to create the output image. 
% In the result (output), objects smaller than q×q are supposed to be eliminated.
% This means that, at those pixels o_thresh is equal to 1, the output image
% (output) has to be equal to the input image (im). At those pixels o_thresh is equal to 0,
% the output image (output) has to be equal to the intensity value of the background (B).
%
% HINT: Let us give an example. Assume that you have created a mask, holding 
% logical values 0 or 1. Assume that you want OUT to be equal to the image IN1, 
% where mask is 1, and equal to IN2 where mask is 0. This can be done by
% the following command:
%
% OUT= mask.*IN1 + (~mask.*IN2);
%
% Create the output image here:


output = (o_thresh.*im) + (o_thresh.*B); % the output image



%% Test your code
% Test your code on at least four different input images, as specified 
% in the document for Lab2 (Task 3).
%
%
%% Answer this question:
% Why couldn't your code eliminate one of the 2x2 objects in test4 when q=2? 
% Your answer here:
%
%   Enligt n_Formula är det minsta filtret 7x7 för bilden. Filtret tar ut
%   medelvärdet av omgivningen, så om ett litet objekt ligger nära ett annat
%   objekt kommer filtret att plocka in bådas värden. Medelvärdet för
%   filtret kommer då att vara större än Q/4. Därav ser objektet större ut
%   och inte bli bortfiltrerat.
