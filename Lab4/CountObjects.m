function [IMG, noRice, noSmallMacs, noLargeMacs]=CountObjects(in)
%% Lab4, Task 3
%% Finds the number of rows of bricks

%% Syntax of the function
%      Input arguments:
%           in: the original input RGB color image of type double scaled between 0 and 1
%          
%      Output arguments:
%           IMG: the output RGB color image, displaying the three
%           diffferent classes of objects in different colors
%           noRice: Number of grains of rice in the input image
%           noSmallMacs: Number of small macaromis in the input image
%           noLargeMacs: Number of large macaromis in the input image

%
%% General rules
%
% 1) Don't change the structure of the template by removing %% lines
%
% 2) Document what you are doing using comments
%
% 3) Before submitting make the code readable by using automatic indentation
%       ctrl-a / ctrl-i
%
% 4) Often you must do something else between the given commands in the
%       template
%
%% Here starts your code.
% Write the appropriate MATLAB commands right after each comment below.
%

%% Make the input color image grayscale, 
% by choosing its most appropriate channel 

% 3 hade mest kontrast
bgray =in(:,:,3); % The grayscale version of the input color image
    
%% Threshold your image
% to separate the objects from the backgroound
Otsu = graythresh(bgray);

b_thresh = bgray<Otsu; % The thresholded image
    
%% Clean up the binary image 
% Use morphological operations to clean up the binary image from noise. 
% Especially make syre that your cleaned image don't contain any false object
% (i.e. single foreground pixels, or groups of connected foreground pixels, 
% that do not belong to the object classes  

r = 4;

SE = strel('disk',r);

IM2 = imopen(b_thresh, SE);
IM3 = imclose(IM2, SE);

b_clean =IM3; % Cleaned up binary image

%imshow(b_clean);

%% Labelling
%  Use labelling to assign every object a unique number

L =bwlabel(b_clean); % Labelled image
    
%% Object features
% Compute relevant object features that you can use to classify 
% the three classes of objects

Stats = regionprops(L,'Area'); % Create struct with relevant object properties

for n=1:length(Stats) % the number of properties
 Area(n)=Stats(n).Area;
end


%% Object classification
% Based on your object features, classify the objects, i.e. for each
% labelled object: decide if it belongs to the three classes: Rice, SmallMacs, or LargeMacs 
% In case you didn't suceed in cleaining up all false objects, you should
% discard them here, so they don't count as the classes  of objects

Rice = find(Area<=1500); % Vector containing the labels of all objects classifies as rice
SmallMacs = find(Area>1500 & Area<5000); % Vector containing the labels of all objects classifies as SmallMacs
LargeMacs = find(Area >= 5000);% Vector containing the labels of all objects classifies as LargeMacs

%% Count the objects for each class.

noRice = length(Rice) % Number of rices
noSmallMacs = length(SmallMacs) % Number of small macoronis
noLargeMacs = length(LargeMacs) % Number of large macoronis

%% Create an RGB-image, IMG, displaying the different classes of objects in different colors
% Use for example: Colored objects on black background, colored objects on
% the original background, highlight the borders of the objects in the
% original image in different colors (or some other way of displayig the
% objects)

[r,c]=size(L);

RiceImage = zeros(r,c);
for n=1:length(Rice)
 RiceImage(L == Rice(n)) = 1;
end
RGBImage(:,:,1)= RiceImage;

SmallMacaroonsImage = zeros(r,c);
for n=1:length(SmallMacs)
 SmallMacaroonsImage(L == SmallMacs(n)) = 1;
end
RGBImage(:,:,2)= SmallMacaroonsImage;

BigMacaroonsImage = zeros(r,c);
for n=1:length(LargeMacs)
 BigMacaroonsImage(L == LargeMacs(n)) = 1;
end
RGBImage(:,:,3)= BigMacaroonsImage;

imshow(RGBImage);

IMG = RGBImage;  % Output RGB-image displaying the three classes of objects in different colors

%% Test your code on the three test images
% % Your code is supposed to work for the three images:
